This is a Task Management API built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT for user authentication. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Authentication is required for performing operations, and we are using JWT stored in cookies for secure access.

Features
User Authentication: Login and register using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Task CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Secure Access: Authentication is handled through JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies.
Technologies Used
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB (Mongoose)
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
Cookies for storing tokens securely
Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
MongoDB
Postman or curl for API testing
